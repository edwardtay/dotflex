# Contract Metadata Directory

This directory should contain the contract metadata JSON files generated by `cargo-contract`.

## VRF Lottery Contract

After building the contract, copy the metadata file here:

```bash
cp ../../contracts/vrf-lottery/target/ink/vrf_lottery/metadata.json ./vrf_lottery.json
```

The frontend will automatically load this file to interact with the deployed contract.

## File Structure

```
public/contracts/
  ├── vrf_lottery.json  # VRF Lottery contract metadata
  └── README.md         # This file
